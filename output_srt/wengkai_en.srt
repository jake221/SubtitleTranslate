1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,190
Computer is our daily necessities. Our 

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,870
daily life is inseparable from the computer. 

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,550
Whether you 

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,170
are using the computer directly or not, you are using 

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,610
the computer intentionally or unintentionally, 

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,780
or using the computer to provide you with 

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,160
services, 

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,050
such as you go. Bank withdrawal ATM is a computer, 

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,790
you withdraw 

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,730
money on the counter, the 

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,410
bank’s resources are also used by the computer.

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,890
When we use a computer, we all need to 

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,680
use the software already on the computer. For 

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,450
example, if 

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,710
you are using a mobile phone, of 

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,510
course, we must first say that the mobile phone is 

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,090
also a 

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,130
computer. When we want to use the 

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,560
mobile phone, what we want is where to go. An app 

20
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,420
instead of saying that we have to write an app 

21
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,060
ourselves

22
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,460
Of course, if you searched all the 

23
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:47,970
markets, 

24
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,360
you can't find the APP you want. Maybe 

25
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,760
you have to write one yourself at this 

26
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,060
time.

27
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,770
If you have a special request on the computer, 

28
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,000
you 

29
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,350
want to do a special thing, you 

30
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,390
can't find the right software, 

31
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,480
maybe you still have to write a software yo

32
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:02,940
urself.

33
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,520
But this kind of thing about writing software 

34
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,300
is rare in modern 

35
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,570
times, right? 

36
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,440
Most people don't need to write their own software.

37
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,550
So what is the purpose of our program 

38
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,110
design? The 

39
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,770
important purpose is not to say that you 

40
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,890
have to write a software 

41
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,990
for yourself. The important purpose is 

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,350
to learn 

43
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,490
how to work with the computer, how the computer 

44
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,940
is good at what kind of things, what 

45
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,440
the computer can do, What kind of 

46
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,180
thing is that computers are not easy to do or 

47
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,400
are not good at doing.

48
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,360
So how does the computer generally solve the 

49
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:32,700
problem? 

50
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,810
For example, if we eat in a restaurant, just 

51
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,720
sit down, I hope 

52
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,580
to drink a glass of water, I 

53
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,240
might say to Wetter, please give 

54
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,720
me a glass of water.

55
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,080
Because this Viter is a 

56
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,880
human, he is not a computer, 

57
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,460
so just tell him, please 

58
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,680
give me a glass of water.

59
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,070
Of course, it will know how to give you a 

60
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,950
glass of water. He 

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,310
will turn to the kitchen, 

62
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,870
find a cup, pour a 

63
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,490
glass of water for you, 

64
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,420
and then bring it to you.

65
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,240
But for a computer, if you 

66
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,750
want him to do something for you, it may 

67
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,520
not be as good as automation. Maybe you need 

68
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,280
to tell the computer how to do it step by 

69
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,510
step, for example, you 

70
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,230
might say to the rig. You have to turn 

71
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,240
around and go to the 

72
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,760
kitchen, then find a cup, then 

73
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,150
find a kettle, then pour 

74
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,170
some water into the cup, and finally 

75
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,140
take the cup back to the table.

76
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,690
The computer is like this. In 

77
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,420
fact, let’s say that he is a computer. He is 

78
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,420
very smart and intelligent. In 

79
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,160
fact, the computer will not do anything.

80
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,360
The computer will only do one 

81
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,990
thing, that is, if you want it to be done 

82
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,360
step by step, he will show you step by step.

83
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,740
Of course, what is his greatest 

84
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,500
ability? You told him to 

85
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,410
do this step, he will not 

86
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,610
take that step, he will do everything you want 

87
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,070
him 

88
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,480
to do well, but he does not know how to string 

89
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,100
these 

90
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,570
steps to meet your 

91
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,390
requirements, how to go Put these steps 

92
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,170
together, this is what you do as a person

93
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,740
So when I face a person, we just 

94
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,080
have to say what that person, what 

95
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
do I want you to 

96
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,260
do, and of course he knows what to do.

97
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,060
But in the face 

98
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,550
of the computer, we have to 

99
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,050
tell it how to 

100
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,580
do, how to make this thing

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,400
When we want to tell the 

102
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,160
computer, we want the computer to know how 

103
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,500
to make a thing, we need 

104
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,170
to have a certain way, we need 

105
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,810
to have a certain means to describe this 

106
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,670
step, 

107
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,500
then this means is called a program

108
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,410
The program is a special programming language 

109
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,350
to write a way to express how we want the 

110
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,550
computer to solve the problem.

111
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,500
In other words, what is the role of programming 

112
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,420
language? We use a programming language to tell 

113
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,280
the computer, I want you to do it step by step, 

114
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,900
how to go to the kitchen to get water to give me drink

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,520
So we are not using a programming language to 

116
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,690
talk to a computer. We 

117
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,730
use a programming language to write down the 

118
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,330
steps to do things for the computer 

119
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,740
and let the computer execute.

120
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,150
Conversation is another 

121
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,110
thing. If we take a computer as a person, 

122
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,610
what 

123
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,130
is our conversation with the computer? 

124
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,390
It’s 

125
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,260
actually the actions you usually do on 

126
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,980
your computer. 

127
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,310
For example, if you see a piece of 

128
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,620
software 

129
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,300
on the desktop, you 

130
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,010
want to attract him, you double click

131
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,490
Double click is the way you talk to him. 

132
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,800
You are ordering it to do 

133
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,310
things. Then he runs the 

134
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,120
software and shows you the software 

135
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,710
running. It is his feedback to you. This 

136
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,420
is a conversation, but the 

137
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,430
programming language 

138
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
is not. Used to talk, you are not in 

139
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,750
the process of compiling a language, not 

140
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,130
in a programming language, he 

141
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,630
makes a sentence, 

142
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,510
this is not the same

143
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,040
What language does the computer 

144
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,790
know? The computer actually only knows the 

145
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,590
language on our 

146
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,810
screen. What you see above is a series of 

147
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,520
numbers. You may feel 

148
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,180
strange. Is there a letter 

149
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,170
here? That's right, this is a 

150
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,450
hexadecimal 

151
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,680
number, because there is a hexadecimal 

152
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,820
number, that is, it 

153
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,450
has a number from 0 to 15, each bit has 

154
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,930
a number from 0 to 15, so the Arabic 

155
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,050
number 0 to 9 is not enough. Expressed, we have 

156
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,120
to 

157
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,370
use the letters A to F to express the following 

158
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,270
numbers, 

159
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,670
so there will be letters inside, 

160
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,690
but he is still a 

161
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,030
number, this is a hexadecimal 

162
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,790
number, this is a

163
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,700
This is a program that a computer can understand, 

164
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,240
written in a language that the computer knows.

165
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,390
Obviously this program is 

166
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,320
for you, and it is 

167
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,860
in front of us. No 

168
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,320
one can understand 

169
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,640
it. I don't understand it. I don't 

170
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,680
know what it means to be the CFFA. 

171
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,010
Because 

172
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,640
this piece of program is converted from 

173
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,320
something 

174
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,700
we can understand through 

175
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,910
another piece of software, or through a 

176
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,090
tool, 

177
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,630
what he used to be like this

178
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,060
Of course, before you learn any programming 

179
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,860
language, this paragraph may still be like 

180
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,620
a book for you. 

181
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,160
Although you can probably guess what kind 

182
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,720
of things may be there, what 

183
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,480
is this program doing? This program 

184
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,130
is to use the 辗 division method to 

185
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,540
calculate two numbers, 

186
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,070
which is the greatest common divisor of 

187
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,310
32 and 26 here.

188
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,490
So what you see is this program, although 

189
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,990
this program is that we say that it is 

190
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,110
written in human programming 

191
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,690
language, but can you understand that 

192
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,190
there is another thing on the 

193
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,760
program, we are now listed on the left, 

194
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,050
The series of texts listed on the right, 

195
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,830
the text of this series, 

196
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,960
we call it the algorithm, we 

197
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,310
have to calculate the same

198
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,470
Things we need to have steps, 

199
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,830
we have to tell the computer how to do it, 

200
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,350
just like before going to the 

201
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,020
water, we have to have a step by step step to 

202
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,220
tell the computer, we 

203
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,550
tell the computer that if you 

204
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,760
find that one is already equal to 0, Then we 

205
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,360
will finish the oil is the greatest common 

206
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,000
divisor.

207
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,270
If V is not equal to 0, 

208
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,330
we have to do a series of complicated calculations. 

209
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,270
After we finish, we have to go back to the 

210
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,210
first step, so that we can continue to 

211
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,660
calculate and finally get a result.

212
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,940
Some of thes

213
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,180
So what you see in the computer is the kind of 

214
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,140
binary stuff, and then 

215
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,670
this is what the computer knows, right? Then 

216
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,190
this is something 

217
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,120
that people can understand, but this is 

218
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,280
what programmers can understand. This is something 

219
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,980
that people who have learned programming can understand.

220
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,540
On the Internet is something that ordinary people 

221
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:09,880
can 

222
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,650
understand. This is how to do the calculation, 

223
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,640
that is, the algorithm.

224
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,060
There are many steps in the middle of everything from 

225
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,690
algorithms 

226
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,930
to programs to things that computers 

227
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,230
can run. There are many things to do.

228
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,520
So we have to let the computer do the calculations, 

229
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,970
we need to find the calculation steps like this, 

230
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,180
and then the programmer will write it out.

231
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,010
Everything we do with a computer is called calculation. It is 

232
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,710
not that only 

233
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,140
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 

234
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,960
are performed. Arithmetic operations are called 

235
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,100
calculations. All things that are done by computers are calc

236
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,660
ulations.

237
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,060
Including calculating your 

238
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,290
birthday, including drawing a 

239
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,050
picture, including showing you a movie, 

240
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,180
this is all calculations, 

241
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,200
as long as the computer does things are calculations.

242
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,180
The calcula
