Hello everyone, 

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,130
I am Wang Jingkun, 

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,130
I will introduce you to the statistical learning 

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,170
method today. Computers and networks have been integrated 

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,740
into people's daily work and life, 

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,720
and become indispensable assistants and partners. The 

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,110
rapid development of computers and networks 

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,490
has completely changed people's learning and lifestyle. 

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,570
Intelligentization 

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,180
is a major goal of computer research and 

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,570
development. Practices in 

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,150
recent decades have shown that statistical 

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,700
learning methods are the most effective means of 

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,900
achieving this goal, 

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,640
although it still has certain limitations. The author 

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,830
has been engaged in the research of various intelligent 

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,750
processing of text data using statistical learning 

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,370
methods.
